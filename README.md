Still in active development, this mod's principal feature aims to be an alternative to the Steam Leaderboards for custom charts played using [TrombLoader](https://github.com/tc-mods/TrombLoader).

### Instructions

Charts being tracked can be searched in https://toottally.com/search/ or accessed programmatically in https://toottally.com/api/songs/
Charts can be manually uploaded in https://toottally.com/upload/
